= Introduction to Data Structures

Data structures are fundamental building blocks in computer science that allow us to organize and store data efficiently.

== What is a Data Structure?

#definition(title: "Data Structure")[A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively.]
The choice of data structure often depends on the specific requirements of your program:
- How will the data be accessed?
- How often will data be inserted or removed?
- What are the memory constraints?

== Common Data Structures

=== Arrays

Arrays are the most basic data structure, storing elements of the same type in contiguous memory locations.

#example[
  In Python, we can create an array (list) like this:
  ```python
  numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  print(numbers[0])  # Output: 1
  ```
]

#important[
  Array indexing typically starts at 0 in most programming languages!]

=== Linked Lists

A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, and each node contains data and a reference to the next node.

#theorem(title: "Linked List Access Time")[
  Accessing an element at position $n$ in a linked list requires $O(n)$ time complexity.
]

Advantages of linked lists:
- Dynamic size
- Efficient insertion/deletion at the beginning

Disadvantages:
- No random access
- Extra memory overhead for pointers

=== Stacks

A stack follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.

#note-box[
  Think of a stack of plates - you can only add or remove plates from the top!
]

Key operations:
- *Push*: Add element to top
- *Pop*: Remove element from top
- *Peek/Top*: Look at top element without removing

=== Queues

A queue follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.

Basic queue operations:
- *Enqueue*: Add element to rear
- *Dequeue*: Remove element from front

== Time Complexity Analysis

Understanding the efficiency of operations is crucial:

| Operation | Array | Linked List | Stack | Queue |
|-----------|-------|-------------|-------|-------|
| Access    | O(1)  | O(n)        | O(1)  | O(1)  |
| Search    | O(n)  | O(n)        | O(n)  | O(n)  |
| Insertion | O(n)  | O(1)        | O(1)  | O(1)  |
| Deletion  | O(n)  | O(1)        | O(1)  | O(1)  |

#dtu-highlight[
  Big O notation describes the upper bound of time complexity as input size approaches infinity.
]

== Mathematical Foundations

Many data structure operations can be analyzed mathematically.

For a binary search on a sorted array of size $n$:
$ T(n) = T(n/2) + O(1) $

This recurrence relation gives us:
$ T(n) = O(log n) $

== Advanced Topics

=== Hash Tables

Hash tables provide average-case $O(1)$ lookup time using hash functions.

#example[
  A simple hash function for integers might be:
  $ h(k) = k mod m $
  where $m$ is the size of the hash table.
]

=== Trees

Tree structures are hierarchical data structures with many variants:
- Binary trees
- Binary search trees
- AVL trees
- Red-black trees

== Conclusion

Choosing the right data structure is essential for writing efficient programs. Consider:

1. What operations will be performed most frequently?
2. What are the memory constraints?
3. Is the data size known in advance?

#important[
  Practice implementing these data structures to better understand their behavior and performance characteristics.

- Tree traversal algorithms
- Graph representations
